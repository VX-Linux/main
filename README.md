**Features**

- Minimal theming, no bloat or bling bling
- Uses the default Void repos

**NEW: Overhauled Tools**

- Appmaker: Create apps for your favourite online activities
- Backup: Backup your entire installation (single file system only)
- Cleanup: Empty trash and package cache, remove unused kernels and packages
- Mirrors: Select and activate custom mirrors (Fastly CDN is the default)
- Timezone: Automatically set timezone to current location
- Update VX: Update all VX files, scripts and utilities, along with any bugfixes for issues reported by users

**Update Notifier**
- When logging in you will be notified if new package updates are available. Update to remove the "nag" or ignore it to let updates build up. Remove "Notifier" from Autostart to remove the check.

**Sudo Password**
- Sudo password is disabled to make setup & daily management more convenient for the user. To disable this delete /etc/sudoers.d/wheel. Most VX utilities will then not work correctly.

**Login**
- anon / live
